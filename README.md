## Implementation of a Social Media API using FastAPI

> This Repository acts a test to what i am currently covering

## WHat I Have Learnt So Far
1. getting, updating, posting and deleting data using Endpoints
2. Using Raw SQL to fetch data from a database - PostgresSql
3. Using Sqlalchemy which acts as an ORM instead of interacting directly with the database
4. Using Schema's to act as a guide on what the user should use both requesting and responding models
