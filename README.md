## Implementation of a Social Media API using FastAPI

## WHat I Have Learnt So Far
1. getting, updating, posting and deleting data using Endpoints
2. Using Raw SQL to fetch data from a database - PostgresSql
3. Using Sqlalchemy which acts as an ORM instead of interacting directly with the database
4. Using Schema's to act as a guide on what the user should use both requesting and responding models
5. Authentication Using JWT token 
6. Use of Composite keys to interact with other Databases
7. Use of Alembic as a Database Migration Tool
